Oh boy, where do I start? Running one of the world's largest MongoDB deployments was an adventure, to say the least. Kinda like bungee jumping one-handed into a vat of various colored LEDs - fascinating, at times overwhelming, and always glowing.

## Harnessing The Beast

We started small, casual, almost careless - developers loved the efficiency, the flexibility, the ease of shoving in JSON data into MongoDB. No awkward table schemas, no need to overthink the database structure. But as we grew in users (and consequently data), we started realizing that maybe MongoDB was too much of a free spirit for our increasingly complex needs. 

Our friendly little Toy Story "Infinity and Beyond!" database was starting to resemble more of a Frankenstein's monster.

## Indexing or Taxing?

The first hiccup, or hic-bump, we hit was the _"scan-and-filter"_ approach. Early on, it was smooth sailing - but as data increased, performance snails raced glacial movements for the slowest award. It was obvious our setup needed an indexing intervention.

However, indexing in MongoDB is like playing "Tetris" where every move has consequences. We hiccuped a deployment that brought the system to a crawl because we were creating an extensive index on our gargantuan usersâ€™ collection in the middle of peak usage. Massive facepalm moment, but lesson learnt.

## Sharding: A Band-Aid on a Bullet Hole?

Speaking of performance, scaling MongoDB can be... a thrill ride. Welcome to Sharding Hill! Sharding lets you split large data sets across machines - theoretically awesome for performance. But like feeding a Gremlin after midnight, things can get messy really, really quickly. 

Your routing, cluster balancing, and failover management gets notably complicated and the effort to shard correctly is no unicorn ride either. Did it solve our immediate performance issues? Sure. Was it a scalpel-precise surgical solution? Not by a long shot.

## Backup Roulette

Backing up MongoDB is sort of like riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire. And you're on fire. And everything is on fire. 

To be specific, we had two options - `mongodump` and filesystem snapshots. `mongodump`, for our large datasets, was like trying to fill an ocean with a dropper. Filesystem snapshots, on the other hand, needed locking or secondary member reads - neither great for a production system that never sleeps. 

Our story ended happily though. After a lot of failed potions and sleepless nights, we finally concocted a tailored disaster recovery plan using our infrastructure provider's backup services, combined with MongoDB's own oplog replication.

Jokes aside, MongoDB is like a wild stallion. Incredibly powerful if you can tame it, slightly terror-inducing if it runs free. My recommendation for anyone planning a large MongoDB deployment? _Try not to do it if your use case doesn't REALLY need it_. Keep things simple, and tame the beast before it gets a chance to grow fangs.
